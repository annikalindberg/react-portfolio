        title: "My Code Diary",
        description: "This project was part of a code challenge where I was instructed to build a diary app. The app allows users to view, sort, and paginate diary entries, and features a professional UI thanks to Material-UI and Styled-components. Designed for scalability and extensibility, it's also pre-configured for API integration. Moving forward, I think it would be really fun to also integrate a server-side rendering, by building a backend API to store the data. Since I am a huge fan of Bullet Journaling, I would like to make integrations with local media like images, screenshots etc. And add icons to build on the filtering feature to be more advanced.",

        title: "Wordgame Swedish Weather",
        description: "I initiated this project as an assignment from one of my mentors, who requested a Hangman game implementation. To infuse creativity, I tweaked the UI changing the theme to make it suitable for kids to practice Swedish and/ or English words. This way, players with basic knowledge of these languages can enjoy the game. Ive continued this challenge after feedback and iterations together with my mentors. Since deploying the app I've made some refactoring of the code.IÂ´ve also changed the rendering method from using mock- data to fetching from a real API.Implementing the changes will require some overall theme changes and tweaks to match the logics of the game theme.",

It allowed me to explore Redux in depth, focusing on concepts such as async actions and reducers. Working in pairs, we got to challenge ourselves in effectively integrate APIs with Redux, utilizing thunks and structuring the Redux store to suit our data.The game also features reusable components and the capability to send JSON in request bodies, showcasing the practicality and versatility of the project.",

I implemented custom reducers and utilized the createSlice-method in Redux Toolkit, to manage application state in a modular fashion. While the frontend styling was achieved using vanilla CSS, the primary focus was on mastering state management through Redux.This involved experimenting with different code organization strategies, including slicing the codebase for optimized maintainability and readability.',

We implemented asynchronous data fetching techniques to retrieve content from an external movie database API. Key React hooks such as useNavigate and useParams were employed to enhance navigation and capture route parameters. For secure and efficient configuration management, we incorporated environment variables stored in a .env file.This allowed us to abstract sensitive information, such as API keys, away from the codebase, enhancing security and maintainability.',
